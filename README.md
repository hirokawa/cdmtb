Control System Design Toolbox in Python for Coefficient Diagram Method (CDM) 

Coefficient Diagram Method (CDM) is control system design method proposed by Retired Prof. Shunji Manabe [Manabe's CDM Tutorial](http://www.cityfujisawa.ne.jp/~manabes/CDMRef2011-8-3/BriefTutorialCdm(AC028102)2002b.pdf).
CDM is an unique control system design method using an algegraic control design approach based on the coefficient of characteristic polynomials. The design tradeoff between stability and the response and the robustness analysis can be conducted in the coefficient diageam.

The detail of CDM is described in CDM Book[^1].
